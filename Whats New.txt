**********
-General
    + Lazarus (Linux and OSX)

       - Fixed search function within a ZIP, it was doubling the results
       - Optional libraries: Zlib and IPF (CAPS Image)
       - Needed libraries: SDL2 and SDL2 Mixer
    + Delphi (Windows)
       - Optional library: IPF (CAPS Image), the Zlib library is included on Delphi and don't need a external library
       - Needed library: SDL2

    + Audio: Simplified the creation of audio emulated device, the audio CPU information is saved internally (number and CPU clock), so it is no longer necessary to add it when initializing a sound chip
    + M68000: Fixed and added the timings of all opcodes
    + Z80: Fixed LDD and LDDR (Was fixed on Spectrum Z80 engine, but I forget to update!)
    + Loading dynamically the necessary libraries. No more errors if the SDL2 library is not present, warns and finishes execution. If Zlib or IPF libraries are not available, do not perform the function but continues execution.

       - Fixed sector selection when it's deleted and SK is selected

    + Fixed removal of the IRQ when values are modified in the GA. It fixes audio speed and video timings in some games.
    + M6845 video: The address value is calculated with a table. 32k screen display effect and hardware scrolling now work
    + Implemented snapshots. Now load and save in 'SNA' format.

DSP 0.3 WIPß4 09/11/04
*************
-General
   + NEW: Icons changed...
   + BUG: Fixes here and there to get more stable DSP.
-Spectrum
   + BUG: Fixed stupid bug in 128K screen, now 'La Abadia del Crimen' works and many games that uses additional screen works too (Loading screen in 'Avenger' and 'Death Wish 3').
   + BUG: Kempston joystick bug fixed, now in 'Silent Shadow' works Kempston joystick.
   + BUG: Fixed bit 6 dependency of $FE port, when speaker sounds or ear sets '1' . This gets better keyboard read, and now 'Ole Toro' acceps a key when pressed.
   + BUG: Bug fixed in sound chip, now music in 'Deatwish 3' don't stop.
   + BUG: Rewrite from scratch tape system:
           - If you load a tape (TAP or TZX) and press 'LOAD ""' it sets 'play' and maximum speed by default.
           - Fixed the way 'Loop's' where show.
           - Now if there are more tha 255 elements, you can chage tape possition (Dinamic and BleepLoad loaders)
           - Rewrited (again) TZX conversion system and TZX next bloq, many loaders now load and don't fail ramdom
           - Now if you change from TAP to TZX and it's loading, tape possition changes OK.

Now some amazing case, I have tested many TZX tapes and I found two of them that don't load: 'Basil the Great Mouse Detective' and 'Mask'.
My first reaction was use RealSpec and 'surprise!', they don't load too... I use EmuZWin the same results... very extrange.
Looking at tape loader (was the same for both games) I make some modifications in the TZX (I changed header long, if it is even don't load and if it is odd they do) and finaly they load.
In my emulator both load, but in RealSpec, they don't. And in EmuZwin 'BGMD' loads and 'Mask' don't.
Later I test in VBSpec and 'big surprise!' both of them load! (the basic of load system I leardned from here).

This two tapes are in my Spectrum dedicated section in this web (Look in Gremlin Section)
