<h1>DSP Emulator v0.17b2 by Leniad 2001-2017</h1><br>
Well, this is just another emulator... but, what's the difference? This is a pascal open source emulator using Delphi/Lazarus environment. There are not many emulators in pascal...<br>
Yes, its open source, you can compile it yourself. But you cannot use it for commercial purposes.<br>
Since version 0.9b3 has ported to Lazarus/Free Pascal, so there is a Linux 32/64bits version available.<br>
Since version 0.14b3 there is a Mac OSX 32bits WIP version.<br><br>
<b>1-. Emulator</b>
<hr>
- Can natively handle ZIP format. You can load ROMS, tapes, snapshots or disks from a ZIP files.<br>
- Needed library: SDL2: you can download it from the same website emulator or the official website 'www.libsdl.org'. If not present the emulator warns and can not start.<br><br>
The emulator includes inside the ZIP (not in WIP versions) the ROMS for Spectrum 48K/128K/+3 (and variants), Amstrad CPC 464/664/6128 and Coleco.<br><br>
<b>IS NOT ALLOWED DISTRIBUTE THIS EMULATOR WITH COPYRIGHTED ROMS</b><br><br>

<b>2.3.1 Samples</b><hr>
Some games, given the difficulty of emulating old sound systems, uses 'samples'. Such files are portions of digitized sound, played instead of emulating the sound system.<br>
Currently only some drivers use wholly or partly this system.<br>
If you want the emulator to use the samples, put the compressed sample files with the same name as the ROM in a folder named 'samples'.<br>
You can download all the samples from the emulator page<br>
Look at the arcade systems list to know which systems use samples.<br><br>

If you want to add another language, edit any file with the extension '.lng' in the 'LNG' directory, rename it with the name of the language and send it to me to add it to the next version.<br>
If you make any improvements to any driver, processor, main code, etc. or add drivers, please send the changes to me, so they can be added to the main code.<br>
If you use part of the code of the emulator for any non commercial purpose, you only need to add in the documentation/source something like 'Z80 core written by Leniad'. And please send me a email to see the written program. :-)<br><br>
